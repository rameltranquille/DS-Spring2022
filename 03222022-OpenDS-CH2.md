# Random Notes from Ch2.0-2.5 of OpenDS

## ArrayList

**Theorem 2.1:** If an empty *ArrayStack* is created and any sequence of m >= 1 calls to add(i, x) and remove(i) 
are performed,then the total time spent during all calls to resize() is O(n)

tack implements the List interfCe. Ignoring the cost of calls to resize(), an Array Stack supports the operations
get(i), set(i, x) in O(1) AND add(i,x), remove(i) in O(n). 

Beginning with an empty ArrayStack, and performing any sequence of add or remove operations, results in a total
O(N) time spent during all calls to resize. The ArrayStack is an interesting class
as we can implement push(x) as add(n, x) AND pop() as remove(n-1). Making these operations run in 
O(1) amortized time.

*Note: In Java, we can use arraycopy to speed up our copying of an array slightly. However it still has 
most of the same underlying functionality and O(N) time complexity. 



## ArrayQueue
**Theorem 2.2:** An *ArrayQueue* implements the FIFO Queue interface. Ignoring the cost of calls
	to *resize()*, an *ArrayQueue* supports the operations *add(x)* and *remove()* in O(1) time per operation.
	Furthermore, beginning with an empty *ArrayQueue*, any sequence of adds and removes
	operations results in a total of O(m) time spent during all calls to *resize()*
	

## ArrayDeque
The array-based Queue above allows us to efficiently add at one end and remove from the other

This *ArrayDeque* is implemented like the above, implementing the List interface by using the circular 
array technique. 

**Theorem 2.3: An *ArryaDeque* implements the List interface. Ignoring the cost of calls to resize(), it
supports the operations 

- get(i) and set(i, x) in O(1) time per operation; and 
- add(i, x) and remove(i) in O(1+min{i,n-1}) time per operation

Thus, beggining with an empty *ArrayDeque*, performing any sequence of remove or add functions 
results in O(N) time spent during all calls to resize.
