You can download the code and work with it on your own computer, or 
you can work with it in an Ed worksapce. To do the latter, fork the 
workspace first, so that you can edit the files and have full ownership
of the files. 

To work with the code, open the terminal sub-window.
To compile the program, execute 
  javac project1/ColorConverter.java 
To run the program, execute 
  java project1.ColorConverter INPUT_FILE 
(in which the INPUT_FILE is replaced by a name of the input file). 
To run the program with the input file provided in this workspace, execute
  java project1.ColorConverter color_list.txt 
You can also create your own input files to experiment with.
