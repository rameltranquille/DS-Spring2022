# Intro

**[Data Structure:](Data Structure:)** a collection of data items in a memory of a running program that are organizaed in some fashion that allows items to be stored and retrieved by some fixed methods. 

**Algorithms:** A logical sequence of discrete steps that describes a complete solution to a given problem commutable in a finite amount of time and space



"Good programmers worry about data structures and their relationships" - Linus Torvalds

## Code Comparison

*Creating a string full of A*
- Stringbuilder's append function vs String
- *Q* How is memory stored and organizeed for a function 
    
*Iterating over a list of numbers*
- For loop vs for each loop (the second is shorted)
*Creating and searching in collections of Circle objects*
- tree vs linked list (tree is much slower depending on method of creation of tree)
    
*Calculating Fibonacci Numbers*
- recursion vs iterating and storing (recursion can be dangerous, and is not efficient)

## Tips
- Understand the concepts and reasons for doing this
- Use pen and paper 
- Try solving problems by yourself
- Write code solutions yourself
- Treat mistakes and bugs as your friends
- Make friends
